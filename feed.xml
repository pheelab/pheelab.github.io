<p>When performing endoluminal surgery inside the colon using a flexible endoscopic robot, there is a problem of losing visualization and task space due to the collapsing of the surrounding wall. This happens mainly because of the intra-abdominal pressure and peristalsis of the colon. Although insufflation is commonly used for expanding the colon, it does not function when a full-thickness incision is created on the colon wall. To support the collapsing colon and ensure sufficient visualization and task space even with a hole, we developed a deployable colon support structure (CSS) that can be seamlessly adapted to the existing procedures. While the CSS is designed to be small and flexible enough to pass through an endoscopic channel that can be tortuous, it becomes sturdy enough to hold the collapsing/squeezing colon after being deployed. Also, the CSS is collapsible after task completion, for retraction through an endoscopic channel. Through the ex-vivo and in-vivo studies with a swine, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of supporting the colon wall during endoluminal interventions with the CSS. We confirmed that the CSS was easily deliverable and deployable and the created space was large enough to perform surgical tasks using robotic arms.</p>

<p>Haptic feedback is absent in flexible endoscopic surgical robots due to the size constraint of installing sensors on the small robotic arms. Besides, inherent hysteresis caused by the nonlinear friction between tendons and sheaths makes it hard to estimate the distal force by modeling. In this work, we addressed this challenge by proposing a new three-axial force sensor. This standalone device can be seamlessly integrated into the endoscopic robotic arm. Three optical fibers with fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are embedded in the sensing structure, where one is located at the center hole of the structure (ø 1.4 mm) and the other two are eccentrically placed around the structure at 90° apart from each other. This device can measure the pulling force and lateral forces of an articulated surgical instrument. Mechanics analysis has been studied to reveal the link between FBGs’ wavelength shifts and forces caused by the elongation and the bending with a temperature-compensation feature. The sensor has a lateral force sensitivity of 838.386 pm/N, with a measurement resolution of 1.19 mN. Performance comparison with a commercial force sensor Nano17 was made, with measurement errors from 4.50% to 6.18%. In the ex vivo tests, we teleoperated the sensorized grasper to pull, steer, and lift a piece of pig colon tissue. The tool–tissue interaction forces measured by the force sensor were displayed on the computer screen in real time. In addition to the endoscopic robots, the force sensor can also be integrated with other surgical robots such as laparoscopic robots and catheters.</p>

<p>Perforations in the digestive tract are life-threatening, and that is why endoscopic physicians are very cautious when trying to remove cancerous tumors in the stomach or colon: they are afraid of cutting through the organs (i.e., perforations) and they do not have good tools to close the perforation. We developed a flexible endoscopic surgical robot to securely close the perforation by suturing - the gold standard of perforation closure. The tiny, dexterous robotic arms are inserted into the digestive tract via natural orifices (e.g., mouth or anus) and they are teleoperated by the clinician to repair the perforation. In this way, the clinician is able to close the perforation without opening up the patient’s body, a big advance compared to open surgery and laparoscopic surgery. Being able to suture perforations, the clinician can then cut deeper (more cleanly) when removing cancerous tumors that are deeply seeded in the digestive tract wall; he/she can even purposely make a hole on the stomach or colon to reach other organs outside for surgery on these organs; once done, the purposely created hole can then be sutured. This would promote a paradigm shift of current minimally invasive surgery from laparoscopic surgery to Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) which promises scarless and faster recovery.</p>

<p>Intragastric balloons (IGBs), by occupying the space in the stomach and prolonging satiety, is an established method to treat obesity and consequently improves its associated comorbidities, e.g. coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, existing IGBs are often tethered with tubes for gas or liquid delivery or require endoscopic assistance for device delivery or removal, which are usually uncomfortable, costly, and may cause complications. We developed a novel tetherless, magnetically actuated capsule (EndoPil) which can deploy an IGB inside the stomach after being swallowed and being activated by an external magnet. The external magnet attracts a small magnet inside the EndoPil to open a valve, triggering the chemical reaction of citric acid and potassium bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide gas, which inflates a biocompatible balloon (around 120 ml). A prototype, 13 mm in diameter and 35 mm in length, was developed. Simulations and bench-top tests were conducted to test the force capability of the magnetic actuation mechanism, the required force to activate the valve, and the repeatability of balloon inflation. Experiments on animal and human were successfully conducted to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of inflating a balloon inside the stomach by an external magnet.</p>

<p>In most robotic flexible endoscopic systems, the endoscope and instruments are controlled separately by two operators, which may result in communication errors and inefficient operation. Our solution is to enable the surgeon to control both the endoscope and the instruments. We developed a novel teleoperation robotic endoscopic system commanded by one operator using the continuous and simultaneous movements of their two hands and one foot. This 13-degree-of-freedom (DoF) system integrates a foot-controlled robotic flexible endoscope and two hand-controlled robotic endoscopic instruments, a robotic grasper and a robotic cauterizing hook. A dedicated foot interface transfers the natural foot movements to the 4-DoF movements of the endoscope while two other commercial hand interfaces map the movements of the two hands to the two instruments individually. The foot-controlled interface can also be used to control industrial robotic arms by the foot.</p>
