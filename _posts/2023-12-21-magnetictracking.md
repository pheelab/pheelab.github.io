A magnetic sensor-based tracking system, a method, and computer readable media for tracking an apparatus having a magnetic field generating device through an environment having a consistent magnetic field are provided. The magnetic sensor-based tracking system includes the apparatus having the magnetic field generating device, one or more magnetic field sensing devices, and a controller. Each of the one or more magnetic field sensing devices is configured in operation to be located within a sensible range of an expected path of the magnetic field generating device as it passes through the environment, the expected path including a plurality of regions. The controller is coupled to the one or more magnetic field sensing devices and configured in operation to utilize magnetic field sensing of the one or more magnetic field sensing devices to track the apparatus within the environment by obtaining at least one magnetic field reading from at least one of the one or more magnetic sensing devices and computing a position and an orientation of the apparatus within the environment based on at least one solution set obtained from a pre-obtained magnetic field model.
