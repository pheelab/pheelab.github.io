# Foot-Controlled Interface for Robotic Surgery

## Overview

Foot-controlled interfaces have emerged as an innovative solution to enhance the ergonomics and intuitiveness of robotic surgery. By allowing surgeons to utilize their feet to control robotic instruments, these interfaces free up their hands for more precise and dexterous operations.

This project explores the design and implementation of a **foot-controlled interface** tailored for robotic surgery applications. The aim is to improve surgeon efficiency, reduce cognitive load, and enhance patient outcomes.

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Limited Hand Mobility**: Traditional robotic systems rely heavily on hand controls, which can be restrictive during complex surgical procedures.
2. **Ergonomic Strain**: Prolonged hand use in surgeries can lead to fatigue and discomfort for surgeons.
3. **Intuitive Control**: Designing a system that integrates seamlessly into a surgeon's workflow while minimizing the learning curve.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Degree-of-Freedom Control**
The interface supports control over multiple robotic arms simultaneously, providing precise feedback and control for complex movements.

### 2. **Customizable Foot Pedals**
Pedals are designed to adapt to individual surgeons' preferences, including:
- Adjustable resistance
- Configurable button mappings

### 3. **Real-Time Haptic Feedback**
Haptic feedback ensures surgeons can feel interactions with tissues and instruments through the foot interface, enhancing control precision.
