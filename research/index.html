      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images fbggripper.jpg alt fbggripper figure p Vertical farming, a sustainable key for urban agriculture, has garnered attention for its land use optimization and enhanced food production capabilities. The adoption of automation in vertical farming is a pivotal response to labor shortages, addressing the need for increased efficiency, particularly in labor-intensive tasks like harvesting. Although soft robotic grippers offer a significant promise for delicately handling fragile objects, the absence of sensors has hindered their full potential to execute precise and secure grasping. To address this challenge, we present a new solution: a detachable Fiber Bragg Grating-based flexible contact force sensor to capture gripper-vegetable interactions. The sensing module was 3D printed using soft material, and the FBG fiber was attached to the module using epoxy. From evaluation tests, this lightweight sensor demonstrated a wide measurement range of up to 9.87 N, with a high sensitivity of 141.7 pm N, good repeatability, and a hysteresis of 7.96 . Compared to commercial load cells, our sensor achieves a small measurement RMSE of 0.41 N and a percentage error of 4.15 . The sensor was integrated into two robotic 3D-printed soft grippers to enable real-time monitoring of dynamic contact force during vegetable harvesting in vertical farming scenarios. By reflecting contact status, this sensor provides a promising glimpse into the future of agricultural automation, enhancing operational efficiency and strengthening situation awareness and decision-making capabilities in vertical farms. Beyond agriculture, the versatility of this sensor extends to application in areas such as warehousing, logistics, and the food and beverage industry. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Lai, Wenjie, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images growtwine.jpg alt growtwine figure p Vertical farming has emerged as a sustainable, efficient, and climate-resilient food production method, which can improve food security. In most commercial vertical farms, harvesting is carried out manually, which are labor-intensive and costly. Numerous robotic grippers solutions have been developed for harvesting. However, they have limitations like restricted adaptivity, excessive mechanical stress on target, and poor accessibility, hindering their adoption for harvesting. Here, we present a tendon-driven gripper equipped with a capacitance-based contact sensor array. The proposed gripper can grow and twine around the target vegetable and adjust the tightness of its grip based on number of contacts. The proposed gripper can generate 4 to 10 N pulling force on bok choy and can also grip various gourds, leafy and podded vegetables. This work paves the way for harvesting automation in vertical farms. Apart from agriculture field, the smart gripper can also be used to grasp objects with various size, shape and weight in warehouse, and food amp; beverage industry. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Liu, jiajun, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images ngt.jpg alt ngt figure p An affordable and reliable way of confirming the placement of nasogastric tube NGT at point-of-care is an unmet need. Using a novel algorithm and few sensors, we developed a low-cost magnet tracking device and showed its potential to localize the NGT preclinically. Here, we embark on a first-in-human trial. Six male and 4 female patients with NGT from the general ward of an urban hospital were recruited. We used the device to localize the NGT and compared that against chest X-ray CXR . In 5 patients, with the sensors placed on the sternal angle, the trajectory of the NGT was reproduced by the tracking device. The tracked location of the NGT deviated from CXR by 0.55 to 1.63 cm, and a downward tracking range of 17 to 22 cm from the sternal angle was achieved. Placing the sensors on the xiphisternum, however, resulted in overt discordance between the device s localization and that on CXR. Short distance between the sternal angle and the xiphisternum, and lower body weight were observed in patients in whom tracking was feasible. Tracking was quick and well tolerated. No adverse event occurred. This device feasibly localized the NGT in 50 of patients when appropriately placed. Further refinement is anticipated. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Li, Hao, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images trimanipulation.jpg alt trimanipulation figure p Many teleoperation tasks require three or more tools working together, which need the cooperation of multiple operators. The effectiveness of such schemes may be limited by communication issues between individuals. Trimanipulation by a single operator using an artificial third arm controlled together with their natural arms may address this issue. Foot-controlled interfaces have previously shown the capability to be used for the continuous control of robot arms. However, the use of such interfaces for controlling a supernumerary robotic limb in coordination with the natural limbs is not well understood. In this paper, a teleoperation task imitating physically-coupled hands in a virtual reality scene was conducted with 14 subjects to evaluate human performance during trimanipulation. The participants were required to move three limbs together in a coordinated way mimicking three arms holding a shared physical object. It was found that after a short practice session, three-hand trimanipulation with a single subject s hands and foot was still slower than dyad operation. However, they displayed similar performance in their success rate and higher motion efficiency than two people cooperating. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Huang, Yanpei et al.

Understanding the mechanics involved in the insertion process is crucial for the structural design, actuation, sensing, control, and navigation of these flexible medical tools. However, the ever-changing contacts and friction between the insertion shaft and the pathway make the mechanics complicated. Existing analytical models simplify the problem by neglecting the friction and assuming specific boundary conditions that are valid only in a few specific instances. In the meantime, finite element method models have tradeoffs between computation speed, accuracy, and stability. This article presents an efficient theoretical framework to model the insertion process with friction, promoting fast and accurate computation of the mechanics involved. The inserting shaft is segmented based on the evolving contacts; system equations are formulated with friction-included force equilibrium and boundary conditions. The model is verified through experiments; channels with different shapes curvatures were considered. The root-mean-square errors between the model and measured insertion forces are less than 0.055 N average percentage error less than 9.62 . This model will enhance the fundamental understanding of the insertion process s mechanics and benefit the engineering design, actuation, and control and medical practices of related medical tools e.g., endoscopic instruments and catheters . p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Liu, Jiajun, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images lowcostngt.jpg alt ngt figure p In this work, we aim to achieve low-cost real-time tracking for nasogastric tube NGT insertion by using a tracking method based on two magnetic sensors. Currently, some electromagnetic EM tracking systems used to detect the misinsertion of the NGT are commercially available. While the EM tracking systems can be advantageous over the other conventional methods to confirm the NGT position, their high costs are a factor hindering such systems from wider acceptance in the clinical community. In our approach, a pair of magnetic sensors are used to estimate the location of a permanent magnet embedded at the tip of the NGT. As the cost of the magnet and magnetic sensors is low, the total cost of the system can be less than one-tenth of that of the EM tracking systems. The experimental results exhibited that tracking can be achieved with a root mean square error RMSE of 2 5 mm and indicated a great potential for use as a point-of-care test for NGT insertion, to avoid misplacement into the lung and ensure correct placement in the stomach. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Miyasaka, Muneaki, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images CSS.jpg alt Force sensor figure p When performing endoluminal surgery inside the colon using a flexible endoscopic robot, there is a problem of losing visualization and task space due to the collapsing of the surrounding wall. This happens mainly because of the intra-abdominal pressure and peristalsis of the colon. Although insufflation is commonly used for expanding the colon, it does not function when a full-thickness incision is created on the colon wall. To support the collapsing colon and ensure sufficient visualization and task space even with a hole, we developed a deployable colon support structure CSS that can be seamlessly adapted to the existing procedures. While the CSS is designed to be small and flexible enough to pass through an endoscopic channel that can be tortuous, it becomes sturdy enough to hold the collapsing squeezing colon after being deployed. Also, the CSS is collapsible after task completion, for retraction through an endoscopic channel. Through the ex-vivo and in-vivo studies with a swine, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of supporting the colon wall during endoluminal interventions with the CSS. We confirmed that the CSS was easily deliverable and deployable and the created space was large enough to perform surgical tasks using robotic arms. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong M.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images forcesensor2.jpg alt Force sensor figcaption class figure-caption Force sensor integration with an articulated surgical gasper. figcaption figure p Haptic feedback is absent in flexible endoscopic surgical robots due to the size constraint of installing sensors on the small robotic arms. Besides, inherent hysteresis caused by the nonlinear friction between tendons and sheaths makes it hard to estimate the distal force by modeling. In this work, we addressed this challenge by proposing a new three-axial force sensor. This standalone device can be seamlessly integrated into the endoscopic robotic arm. Three optical fibers with fiber Bragg gratings FBGs are embedded in the sensing structure, where one is located at the center hole of the structure ø 1.4 mm and the other two are eccentrically placed around the structure at 90 apart from each other. This device can measure the pulling force and lateral forces of an articulated surgical instrument. Mechanics analysis has been studied to reveal the link between FBGs wavelength shifts and forces caused by the elongation and the bending with a temperature-compensation feature. The sensor has a lateral force sensitivity of 838.386 pm N, with a measurement resolution of 1.19 mN. Performance comparison with a commercial force sensor Nano17 was made, with measurement errors from 4.50 to 6.18 . In the ex vivo tests, we teleoperated the sensorized grasper to pull, steer, and lift a piece of pig colon tissue. The tool tissue interaction forces measured by the force sensor were displayed on the computer screen in real time. In addition to the endoscopic robots, the force sensor can also be integrated with other surgical robots such as laparoscopic robots and catheters. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Lai, Wenjie, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images mibc.jpg alt mibc figure p This paper presents a two magnetic sensor based tracking method for a magnetically inflated intragastric balloon capsule MIBC which is used for obesity treatment. After the MIBC is swallowed, it is designed to be inflated inside the stomach by approaching a permanent magnet PM externally near the abdomen. However, if the balloon inflation is accidentally triggered while the MIBC is still in the esophagus, the esophagus will be damaged. Therefore, to safely inflate the MIBC, we aim to track the MIBC s position along the esophagus and confirm the MIBC passes through. Typically, magnetic sensor based tracking systems tend to be bulky and costly since they involve computationally intensive optimization with many magnetic sensors. To solve those problems, we develop an algorithm that estimates the position of the PM inside the MIBC by using the grid search combined with the dynamically confined search range and search threshold modulation. Our tracking method achieved an average 1D position error of 3.48 mm which is comparable to the up to 4 mm average error for the other magnetic sensor based tracking systems that require more sensors and computational power compared to our system. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p strong Paper: strong Miyasaka, Muneaki, et al.

      <p data-search="p img src https: pheelab.github.io images sewingup.jpg alt Crepe class mx-auto d-block p p Perforations in the digestive tract are life-threatening, and that is why endoscopic physicians are very cautious when trying to remove cancerous tumors in the stomach or colon: they are afraid of cutting through the organs i.e., perforations and they do not have good tools to close the perforation. We developed a flexible endoscopic surgical robot to securely close the perforation by suturing - the gold standard of perforation closure. The tiny, dexterous robotic arms are inserted into the digestive tract via natural orifices e.g., mouth or anus and they are teleoperated by the clinician to repair the perforation. In this way, the clinician is able to close the perforation without opening up the patient s body, a big advance compared to open surgery and laparoscopic surgery. Being able to suture perforations, the clinician can then cut deeper more cleanly when removing cancerous tumors that are deeply seeded in the digestive tract wall; he she can even purposely make a hole on the stomach or colon to reach other organs outside for surgery on these organs; once done, the purposely created hole can then be sutured. This would promote a paradigm shift of current minimally invasive surgery from laparoscopic surgery to Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery NOTES which promises scarless and faster recovery. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Cao, Lin, et al.

      <p data-search="p img src https: pheelab.github.io images magnet.jpg alt Crepe class mx-auto d-block p p Intragastric balloons IGBs , by occupying the space in the stomach and prolonging satiety, is an established method to treat obesity and consequently improves its associated comorbidities, e.g. coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, existing IGBs are often tethered with tubes for gas or liquid delivery or require endoscopic assistance for device delivery or removal, which are usually uncomfortable, costly, and may cause complications. We developed a novel tetherless, magnetically actuated capsule EndoPil which can deploy an IGB inside the stomach after being swallowed and being activated by an external magnet. The external magnet attracts a small magnet inside the EndoPil to open a valve, triggering the chemical reaction of citric acid and potassium bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide gas, which inflates a biocompatible balloon around 120 ml . A prototype, 13 mm in diameter and 35 mm in length, was developed. Simulations and bench-top tests were conducted to test the force capability of the magnetic actuation mechanism, the required force to activate the valve, and the repeatability of balloon inflation. Experiments on animal and human were successfully conducted to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of inflating a balloon inside the stomach by an external magnet. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Phan, Phuoc Thien, et al.

      <p data-search="p img src https: pheelab.github.io images footinterface.jpg alt Crepe class mx-auto d-block p p In most robotic flexible endoscopic systems, the endoscope and instruments are controlled separately by two operators, which may result in communication errors and inefficient operation. Our solution is to enable the surgeon to control both the endoscope and the instruments. We developed a novel teleoperation robotic endoscopic system commanded by one operator using the continuous and simultaneous movements of their two hands and one foot. This 13-degree-of-freedom DoF system integrates a foot-controlled robotic flexible endoscope and two hand-controlled robotic endoscopic instruments, a robotic grasper and a robotic cauterizing hook. A dedicated foot interface transfers the natural foot movements to the 4-DoF movements of the endoscope while two other commercial hand interfaces map the movements of the two hands to the two instruments individually. The foot-controlled interface can also be used to control industrial robotic arms by the foot. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Huang, Yanpei, et al.

This paper proposes a deep learning approach to predicting the distal force of TSMs when manipulating a biological tissue based on only proximal-end measurements. Both Multilayer Perceptron MLP and Recurrent Neural Network RNN were investigated to study their capabilities of making sequential distal force predictions. The results were compared with those of the conventional modelling approach. It was observed that, when sufficient data was provided for training, RNN achieved the most accurate prediction RMSE 0.0219N in experiments with constant system velocity. The effects of insufficient training data, varying system velocity and irregular motion trajectories on the performance of RNN were further studied. Notably, RNN could precisely identify the current system phase in the force hysteresis profile and can be applied to TSMs with realistic non-periodic movement such as manual manipulation trajectory RSME 0.2287N . The proposed approach can be applied to any TSM-driven robotic systems for accurate haptic feedback without requiring sensors at the distal ends of the robots. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Li, Xiaoguo, et al.

      <p data-search="figure class figure img src https: pheelab.github.io images variabale stiffness manipulator.jpg alt Force sensor figure p In Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery NOTES , a surgical robot that can access the human colon or stomach via natural orifices should have sufficient flexibility to pass through tortuous paths and to be operated in a confined space. In addition, the robot should possess an acceptable stiffness level to hold payloads during the surgery. This paper presents a new design concept for variable stiffness manipulators using thermoplastic material Polyethylene Terephthalate PET and a flexible stainless steel sheath as a heating media. The stiffness phases of PET can be actively adjusted through temperature. Experiments at different conditions showed that the proposed design was at least as flexible as a typical commercial endoscope in compliant mode and at least 9 times stiffer than the endoscope in stiff mode. In addition, flexural modulus of the proposed manipulator with respect to temperature, current, and time was modeled and validated through both simulation and experiments. A tendon-driven flexible robotic arm integrated with a variable stiffness spine was also developed, and ex vivo tests on fresh porcine tissue were conducted. The manipulator in compliant mode can be easily controlled through the tendons, and it is able to hold its shape against considerably large loads in stiff mode. The results demonstrate not only the high potential of the design concept for the future medical application but also the first steps toward building a complete surgical robotic system with fully controlled variable stiffness. p h3 id related-pubulication Related Pubulication: h3 p class box-note strong Paper: strong Le, Huu Minh, et al.
