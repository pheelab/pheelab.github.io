<p>Vertical farming, a sustainable key for urban agriculture, has garnered attention for its land use optimization and enhanced food production capabilities. The adoption of automation in vertical farming is a pivotal response to labor shortages, addressing the need for increased efficiency, particularly in labor-intensive tasks like harvesting. Although soft robotic grippers offer a significant promise for delicately handling fragile objects, the absence of sensors has hindered their full potential to execute precise and secure grasping. To address this challenge, we present a new solution: a detachable Fiber Bragg Grating-based flexible contact force sensor to capture gripper-vegetable interactions. The sensing module was 3D printed using soft material, and the FBG fiber was attached to the module using epoxy. From evaluation tests, this lightweight sensor demonstrated a wide measurement range of up to 9.87 N, with a high sensitivity of 141.7 pm/N, good repeatability, and a hysteresis of 7.96%. Compared to commercial load cells, our sensor achieves a small measurement RMSE of 0.41 N and a percentage error of 4.15%. The sensor was integrated into two robotic 3D-printed soft grippers to enable real-time monitoring of dynamic contact force during vegetable harvesting in vertical farming scenarios. By reflecting contact status, this sensor provides a promising glimpse into the future of agricultural automation, enhancing operational efficiency and strengthening situation awareness and decision-making capabilities in vertical farms. Beyond agriculture, the versatility of this sensor extends to application in areas such as warehousing, logistics, and the food and beverage industry.</p>

<p>Vertical farming has emerged as a sustainable, efficient, and climate-resilient food production method, which can improve food security. In most commercial vertical farms, harvesting is carried out manually, which are labor-intensive and costly. Numerous robotic grippers solutions have been developed for harvesting. However, they have limitations like restricted adaptivity, excessive mechanical stress on target, and poor accessibility, hindering their adoption for harvesting. Here, we present a tendon-driven gripper equipped with a capacitance-based contact sensor array. The proposed gripper can grow and twine around the target vegetable and adjust the tightness of its grip based on number of contacts. The proposed gripper can generate 4 to 10 N pulling force on bok choy and can also grip various gourds, leafy and podded vegetables. This work paves the way for harvesting automation in vertical farms. Apart from agriculture field, the smart gripper can also be used to grasp objects with various size, shape and weight in warehouse, and food &amp; beverage industry.</p>

<p>An affordable and reliable way of confirming the placement of nasogastric tube (NGT) at point-of-care is an unmet need. Using a novel algorithm and few sensors, we developed a low-cost magnet tracking device and showed its potential to localize the NGT preclinically. Here, we embark on a first-in-human trial. Six male and 4 female patients with NGT from the general ward of an urban hospital were recruited. We used the device to localize the NGT and compared that against chest X-ray (CXR). In 5 patients, with the sensors placed on the sternal angle, the trajectory of the NGT was reproduced by the tracking device. The tracked location of the NGT deviated from CXR by 0.55 to 1.63 cm, and a downward tracking range of 17 to 22 cm from the sternal angle was achieved. Placing the sensors on the xiphisternum, however, resulted in overt discordance between the device’s localization and that on CXR. Short distance between the sternal angle and the xiphisternum, and lower body weight were observed in patients in whom tracking was feasible. Tracking was quick and well tolerated. No adverse event occurred. This device feasibly localized the NGT in 50% of patients when appropriately placed. Further refinement is anticipated.</p>

<p>Many teleoperation tasks require three or more tools working together, which need the cooperation of multiple operators. The effectiveness of such schemes may be limited by communication issues between individuals. Trimanipulation by a single operator using an artificial third arm controlled together with their natural arms may address this issue. Foot-controlled interfaces have previously shown the capability to be used for the continuous control of robot arms. However, the use of such interfaces for controlling a supernumerary robotic limb in coordination with the natural limbs is not well understood. In this paper, a teleoperation task imitating physically-coupled hands in a virtual reality scene was conducted with 14 subjects to evaluate human performance during trimanipulation. The participants were required to move three limbs together in a coordinated way mimicking three arms holding a shared physical object. It was found that after a short practice session, three-hand trimanipulation with a single subject’s hands and foot was still slower than dyad operation. However, they displayed similar performance in their success rate and higher motion efficiency than two people cooperating.</p>

<p>Flexible endoscopy and catheterization typically involve inserting a flexible shaft into a curved channel. Understanding the mechanics involved in the insertion process is crucial for the structural design, actuation, sensing, control, and navigation of these flexible medical tools. However, the ever-changing contacts and friction between the insertion shaft and the pathway make the mechanics complicated. Existing analytical models simplify the problem by neglecting the friction and assuming specific boundary conditions that are valid only in a few specific instances. In the meantime, finite element method models have tradeoffs between computation speed, accuracy, and stability. This article presents an efficient theoretical framework to model the insertion process with friction, promoting fast and accurate computation of the mechanics involved. The inserting shaft is segmented based on the evolving contacts; system equations are formulated with friction-included force equilibrium and boundary conditions. The model is verified through experiments; channels with different shapes/curvatures were considered. The root-mean-square errors between the model and measured insertion forces are less than 0.055 N (average percentage error less than 9.62%). This model will enhance the fundamental understanding of the insertion process’s mechanics and benefit the engineering (design, actuation, and control) and medical practices of related medical tools (e.g., endoscopic instruments and catheters).</p>

<p>In this work, we aim to achieve low-cost real-time tracking for nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion by using a tracking method based on two magnetic sensors. Currently, some electromagnetic (EM) tracking systems used to detect the misinsertion of the NGT are commercially available. While the EM tracking systems can be advantageous over the other conventional methods to confirm the NGT position, their high costs are a factor hindering such systems from wider acceptance in the clinical community. In our approach, a pair of magnetic sensors are used to estimate the location of a permanent magnet embedded at the tip of the NGT. As the cost of the magnet and magnetic sensors is low, the total cost of the system can be less than one-tenth of that of the EM tracking systems. The experimental results exhibited that tracking can be achieved with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2–5 mm and indicated a great potential for use as a point-of-care test for NGT insertion, to avoid misplacement into the lung and ensure correct placement in the stomach.</p>

<p>When performing endoluminal surgery inside the colon using a flexible endoscopic robot, there is a problem of losing visualization and task space due to the collapsing of the surrounding wall. This happens mainly because of the intra-abdominal pressure and peristalsis of the colon. Although insufflation is commonly used for expanding the colon, it does not function when a full-thickness incision is created on the colon wall. To support the collapsing colon and ensure sufficient visualization and task space even with a hole, we developed a deployable colon support structure (CSS) that can be seamlessly adapted to the existing procedures. While the CSS is designed to be small and flexible enough to pass through an endoscopic channel that can be tortuous, it becomes sturdy enough to hold the collapsing/squeezing colon after being deployed. Also, the CSS is collapsible after task completion, for retraction through an endoscopic channel. Through the ex-vivo and in-vivo studies with a swine, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of supporting the colon wall during endoluminal interventions with the CSS. We confirmed that the CSS was easily deliverable and deployable and the created space was large enough to perform surgical tasks using robotic arms.</p>
